Hello, we are team tippety-tap. Our names are Gianna Citriniti, Josh Herendeen and, Cameron Palmer.
Our app is the user authentication app with keystroke dynamics.
To use our app, open the studioproject and open it with Android Studio.
Few quick notes:
-The app doesn't remember users once the app is restarted
-Make sure you minimize the keyboard after user login to see the results which are behind the keyboard
-No users are premade; you will have to create a user everytime you reopen the app
